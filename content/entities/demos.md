# Demos Project

The Demos Project for Studies in the Data Humanities fosters and supports scholarship involving structured data around people (the demos) and their environment. The Demos Project examines the representation of individuals and communities in data, we ask and answer questions about data in society and applies humanistic thinking to data-driven problems. Questions of data representation have broad applicability but are particularly effective for reading and understanding contemporary problems. The representation of people and communities in data is an issue of significant current interest as more and more of our lives are lived online. This center builds upon FSUâ€™s historic strengths in intersectional studies of race, gender, language and society.

The project operates as a physical research/training space and community hub for humanities data analysis and curation; it supports faculty and students in gaining necessary skills for advanced digital humanities projects and catalyzing early-stage and cross-disciplinary projects to be competitive in seeking grants from large funders.
