# Digital Scholars 

**Website**: https://digitalscholars.wordpress.com

“Digital Scholars” is an interdisciplinary reading and discussion group at Florida State University devoted to the digital humanities, instructional technologies, and electronic and online scholarship. Anyone interested in participating can contact Tarez Graban to be added to the e-mail distribution list in Canvas. Graduate students at FSU may also enroll in the group as a one-credit course (ENG 5998, variable section number each term).

The goal of Digital Scholars is to analyze and discuss the trends and critical issues in the digitization of materials, methods, and mindsets in the humanities. Though the group emerges from the English department, its conversations extend well beyond those areas, welcoming  participants from any department, technology center, or library, whatever their particular rank of student, staff, administration, or faculty.

Each year, the [Digital Scholars blog](https://digitalscholars.wordpress.com) also offers events information, meeting reports, resources, and access to other social media and scholarly networks in which the group operates.
