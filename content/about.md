# Digital Humanities at FSU

Digital Humanities initiatives at Florida State University are housed in a number of colleges and academic units around campus. Rather than reporting to one centralized unit, FSU has a "networked model" for engaging in collaborative digital research and scholarship. This site is intended to provide an overview of the many events, initiatives, and groups that students and faculty can participate in if they seek to become more engaged in digital humanities work on campus.
